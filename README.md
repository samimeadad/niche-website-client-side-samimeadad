- The website has been built with various technologies involved. HTML, CSS, React, Firebase Authentication System, Material UI CSS Framework, Node.js, Express.js, and Mongodb is the heart of the website.

- To develop the client-end, React.js is the core technology used. Along with React, for CSS framework, React Material UI CSS framework is our savior.
